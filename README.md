# Coding and Style Guidelines
> Coding, style and configuration guidelines for Entisys360

This repository should serve as the single Source of Truth for the Entisys360 
way of doing things.

This should be a place to find succinct, authoritative answers when creating or 
reviewing code.

Any changes made to the guidelines here should be discussed in the appropriate 
Teams channel and will require approval of 2 approvers prior to merge.

If a repository has requirements that make specific guidelines here 
inappropriate they can be overridden by adding rules to the styleguide.md file 
in a repository's /docs directory.

If you have general tips or recommendations to share that do not meet the 
criteria of being succinct and related specifically to Entisys360 implementation 
of a language or technology, please publish that information in the Teams wiki.
