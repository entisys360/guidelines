# Coding and Style Guidelines
> Coding, style and configuration guidelines for Entisys360 projects

This repository should serve as the single Source of Truth for the Entisys360 
way of doing things.

This should be a place to find succinct, authoritative answers when creating or 
reviewing code.

Any changes made to the guidelines here should be discussed in the appropriate 
Teams channel and will require 2 approvers prior to merge .

If a repository has requirements that make specific guidelines here 
inappropriate they can be overridden by adding rules to the styleguide.md file 
in a repository's /docs directory.

If you have general tips or recommendations to share that do not meet the 
criteria of being succinct and related specifically to Entisys360 implementation 
of a language or technology, please publish that information in the Teams wiki.

## Universal Guidelines

* Adhere to style rules defined in each repository's README.md and styleguide.md 
files.
* Comment your code. Try to make it as clear as possible what you are intending 
with each major section.
* Keep comments relevant as your code evolves.
* If there is an open discussion online about the code or approach you're using, 
include a link in your comment.
* Don't use comments as an excuse for bad code. Keep your code clean.
* Don't use clean code as an excuse to not comment at all.
* Use an [.editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org "editorconfig") file to 
maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs.
* Include code style and syntax checks in your build process.
